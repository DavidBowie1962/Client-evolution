# Client Behavior Analysis in Banking Ecosystem

## Overview

This repository contains the data analysis project focused on understanding how clients interact and evolve within a banking ecosystem. The project utilizes advanced data analysis techniques to uncover patterns and trends that inform strategic decision-making for enhancing client engagement and retention.

## Project Description

The aim of this research is to analyze client behaviors through continuous, cumulative, and inflection point analyses using a variety of data analysis tools including UMAP for dimensionality reduction and DBSCAN for clustering. The findings help in identifying key moments of change in client behavior which could impact retention and loyalty.

### Key Objectives

- **Continuous Analysis:** Observe how client engagement patterns evolve over time.
- **Cumulative Analysis:** Understand broader trends in client behavior across the entire dataset.
- **Inflection Points Analysis:** Identify specific moments when significant changes in behavior occur.
